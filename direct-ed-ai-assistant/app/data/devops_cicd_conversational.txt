DevOps and CI/CD - Conversational
What is DevOps? It’s the culture of developers and operations working together to deliver software faster.

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment.
- CI: Developers merge code changes often, and automated tests check if it works.
- CD: Deploy changes automatically to production if tests pass.

Tools: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Docker, Kubernetes.

Why does it matter? Because instead of releasing software once every year, companies like Facebook release updates multiple times a day. DevOps makes this possible with automation.

So DevOps is like turning software delivery into an assembly line—fast, reliable, and automated.
