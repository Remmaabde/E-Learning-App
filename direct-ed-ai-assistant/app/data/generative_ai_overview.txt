Generative AI Overview
Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) refers to systems capable of creating text, images, code, music, or other content. 
Unlike traditional discriminative AI models, GenAI learns the distribution of data to produce new instances that resemble the training data.
Applications include chatbots, creative writing, drug discovery, design, and education. 
Types: Text-to-Text (LLMs), Text-to-Image (diffusion, GANs), Text-to-Speech, Music generation, and more.
Challenges: Bias, hallucination, copyright, and responsible usage.
