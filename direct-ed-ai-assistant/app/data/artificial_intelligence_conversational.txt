Artificial Intelligence Basics - Conversational
AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is about making machines “think” like humans—or at least solve problems like we do.

Difference between AI, ML, and Generative AI:
- AI: The big umbrella. Any system that mimics human intelligence.
- ML (Machine Learning): A subset of AI. Systems learn from data.
- GenAI: A special type of AI that can generate new content (text, images, music).

Examples:
- AI: Chess-playing program.
- ML: Spam filter that learns from emails.
- GenAI: ChatGPT writing an essay.

So AI isn’t magic—it’s math, algorithms, and data coming together to create systems that appear “intelligent.”
