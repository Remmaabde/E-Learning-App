Operating Systems - Conversational
An Operating System (OS) is the invisible boss of your computer. It manages resources, schedules tasks, and lets you run apps.

When you click on Chrome, it’s the OS that gives Chrome memory, CPU time, and access to the internet.

Key parts:
- Kernel: The core that talks to hardware.
- Process management: Decides which program runs when.
- Memory management: Makes sure apps don’t overwrite each other’s data.
- File system: Organizes your files.

Popular OS:
- Windows: Great for general use and business apps.
- macOS: Optimized for Apple devices.
- Linux: Loved by developers and servers.

So the OS is like the conductor of an orchestra, making sure every instrument (hardware + software) plays in harmony.
