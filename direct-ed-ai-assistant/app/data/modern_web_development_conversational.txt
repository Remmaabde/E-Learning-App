Modern Web Development Overview - Conversational
Web development is about building websites and web apps.

Frontend: What users see (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue). 
Backend: What happens behind the scenes (Node.js, Python, databases).
APIs: The bridges between frontend and backend.

Modern practices:
- Responsive design (works on phones, tablets, desktops).
- Single-page apps (React, Angular).
- REST vs GraphQL APIs.
- Deployment with cloud and containers.

Example: When you order food on Uber Eats, the frontend is the app you click on. The backend is the system connecting to restaurants, processing payments, and sending your order to a driver.

So web development is really teamwork between frontend, backend, and infrastructure.
