Software Engineering Practices - Conversational
Software engineering isn’t just about coding—it’s about building reliable, maintainable systems.

Common practices:
- Version control with Git: Track changes and collaborate.
- Agile methodology: Work in small sprints, adapt quickly.
- Testing: Unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests.
- Clean code: Write code that humans can read, not just computers.

Example: Imagine you’re building a house. Coding is laying bricks. Software engineering is making sure the house has blueprints, quality checks, and is safe for people to live in.

That’s why teams follow engineering practices—to avoid chaos and keep projects maintainable.
