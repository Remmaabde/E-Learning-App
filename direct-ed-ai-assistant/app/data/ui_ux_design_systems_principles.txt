UI/UX Design Systems and Principles
A design system is a collection of reusable components guided by standards.
- Examples: Google Material Design, IBM Carbon Design System.
Principles:
- Consistency across components.
- Scalability for large teams and products.
- Accessibility baked into components.
- Documentation for developers and designers.
- Tokenization (colors, spacing, typography) for theming.
