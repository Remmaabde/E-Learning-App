Computer Networks - Conversational
Let’s talk about the internet. At its core, it’s just a giant network of computers talking to each other.

How do they talk? Through IP addresses. Think of it as the postal address for your computer. DNS (Domain Name System) works like a phone book. Instead of remembering 142.251.32.14, you type google.com, and DNS translates it.

There are two main models: 
- Client-Server: Your browser (client) requests a page, and the web server responds.
- Peer-to-Peer: Computers connect directly, like file-sharing.

Key concepts:
- Routers: They decide the path data takes across networks.
- Packets: Data is chopped into small chunks, sent across, and reassembled at the other end.
- Protocols: Rules for communication (HTTP for web, SMTP for email).

So when you send a WhatsApp message, it doesn’t magically fly. It’s chopped into packets, sent through routers across continents, and reassembled on your friend’s phone.
